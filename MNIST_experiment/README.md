# MNIST Experimentation
## Background
To try and generate ASCII characters, we might be able to modify a diffusion model to make it discrete instead of continuous. This would let us to get to the correct characters as opposed to pixels.

One possible issue is that we're essentially just going to be having the model learn to predict "categories" so it doesn't have any real understanding of what the character is. Not sure if I'm thinking of that right, maybe not.
